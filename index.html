<p style="font-size: 18px; " >The nature and scale of devastation caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to each and every 
<br>    aspect of our lives are disturbing, distressing and tragic to say the least. Despite all scientific 
<br>    advancements made in the last 50 years, we, the human race, appear powerless against the SARS-
<br>    CoV-2 ("virus") which causes the disease known as COVID-19. The spread of this virus has 
<br>    mercilessly exposed the fragility of social policies and safety nets, more particularly the glaring 
<br>    deficiencies of healthcare systems and legal frameworks around the world. Governments are now
<br>    being forced to take drastic measures well-beyond the scope of their powers in existing legislation
<br>    in order to deal with the monumental health and economic crisis arising from this pandemic.
<br>    Powers that are being or are required to be exercised by respective governments are either not 
<br>    expressly provided in or are much wider in scope than what existing legislation permits or are
<br>    spread out over multiple legislation. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">The UK tackled the problem by enacting "The Coronavirus Act 2020", which conferred on the
    <br>     government extensive powers necessary to execute some of the urgent and drastic measures
    <br>     required to deal with the pandemic. It is absolutely critical that the Bangladeshi legislature rises to 
    <br>     the occasion and follows suit by enacting a similar comprehensive, yet temporary, Act. As to what 
    <br>     ought to go into such an Act, if it were to be enacted, guidance may be obtained from the UK Act 
    <br>     which not only explicitly provides the legal basis for the current lockdown of citizens and
    <br>     businesses in the UK, but also travels much further. </p>

   <u > <a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAiECW73usLivqPCSeQRsSUvRQqFAgKIhAlu97rC4r6jwknkEbElL0U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en" style="color: deepskyblue;" >For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.</a> </u>
    

   <h3 style="font-size: 23px;">Some of the core provisions of the Act include:</h3>

   <p style="font-size: 18px;" >(a) Detention of potentially infected persons: A "potentially infectious" person is defined as 
    <br>    someone who "is, or may be, infected with coronavirus" or who has been in "an infected area
    <br>     within 14 days". This grants power to the police, immigration officers and public health officials in
    <br>    the UK to not only arrest infected people but suspected cases. They can then be placed in isolation 
    <br>   and sent to be tested. The UK government already has powers to this effect from the Public Health 
    <br>    (Control of Disease) Act, 1984 including quarantine, detention and compulsory medical
    <br>     examination although there are stricter time-limits for their use. This provision surely impacts on a 
    <br>   UK citizen's right to liberty protected by Article 5 of the Convention of Human Rights. However, this 
    <br>    is a qualified right that public authorities can take proportionate steps to interfere with to protect
    <br>     public health. </p>

     <p style="font-size: 18px;" >(b) Prohibition of events and gatherings: The Act allows the UK government to prohibit public 
    <br>    events and gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. Surely, there would be political protest for 
    <br>    such a measure since it restricts freedom of expression and freedom of assembly especially in light 
    <br>    of the economic fallout including widespread job cuts in the UK which has resulted from this
    <br>     pandemic. But once again, the rights to freedom of assembly and expression are also qualified. The 
    <br>     government can take proportionate steps to curtail them to protect public health. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;" >(c) Reappointment of retired health-care workers: The Act allows retired health-care workers to be
    <br>     brought back to the NHS to tackle this crisis. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;" >(d) Duration: The Act has a maximum duration of two years but may be reviewed every six months.</p>

    <a href="https://asset.com.bd/kalpotaru-uttara/"> <img src="./images/ad 3 news.gif" alt="AD"> </a>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;" >(e) Food Supply Chain Businesses: The Act introduces new measures which require any person closely related to 
    <br>    the food supply chain businesses to disclose such information as may be requested by the Secretary of State from
    <br>    time to time so that the government can counter any potential threats to the food supply chain and strengthen the 
    <br>    existing framework between the food industry and government regulators. </p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 18px;" >(f) Business protection: The Act prevents forfeiture of leases for non-payment of rent for a three-month 
    <br>    period (with a power to extend if needed) for all types of commercial tenants. This option provides
    <br>    a three months' grace period to struggling businesses. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;" >(g) Residential tenancies: The Act extends the notice period for a notice of eviction that a landlord is 
    <br>    required to serve on a tenant to at least three months and also creates a three months' notice 
    <br>    requirement even where existing law requires no notice. However, the provision does not waive a tenant's 
    <br>    liability for rental payments. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;" >(h) Employment Law: The Act allows employees and workers by giving 03 working days' written
    <br>    notice to their employer to take "Emergency Volunteers Leave" to act as volunteers for helping the 
    <br>    NHS and ensures that their employment status in their respective companies are not hampered. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;" >(i) Schools, childcare providers etc: The Act includes a power to direct temporary closure of any 
    <br>    educational institution and a power to temporarily suspend or vary specified requirements in 
    <br>   relation to education and childcare legislation.</p>


<p style="font-size: 18px;" >(j) Courts and tribunals: The Act, by amending existing legislation, allows the use of video/audio-enabled hearings 
<br>    without the need for a physical courtroom with all parties taking part in the hearings using telephone or video conferencing
<br>     facilities. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;" >The powers and measures provided in the Act may, on their own, appear draconian in nature but may reasonably be viewed as
<br>    necessary in the circumstances. Moreover, the Act does provide that any powers which are put in place are to stand for a 
<br>    maximum of two years with a review of the measures to be conducted every six months to assess their necessity in the 
<br>    circumstances. Measures can also be suspended and reactivated later. It will also be possible to extend or end the operation 
<br>    of the provisions of the Act, depending on the scientific evidence. It is hard to imagine how any of us could return to
<br>    pre-COVID-19 ways of leading our lives without an effective vaccine. The adverse economic and social impact of not being able to 
<br>    go back to pre-COVID-19 ways for an extended period of time is staggering. The global scientific community has made one aspect perfectly 
<br>    clear time and again, that a vaccine for COVID-19 is at least 18-24 months away, that being the best case scenario. Therefore, 
<br>    the measures taken by respective governments must continue for at least 02 years, if not more. As such, there is a dire need for the 
<br>   legislature in Bangladesh to urgently pass a similar piece of legislation with a non-obstante clause for a limited duration dedicated to 
<br>    this particular pandemic to address ongoing and potential issues in Bangladesh. A wide range of issues may be addressed 
<br>    including but not limited to: </p>


<p style="font-size: 18px;" >(a) increasing the power of the executive to slow the spread of the virus including an extensive legal 
<br>    basis for lockdowns, quarantine procedures, closure of educational institutions, government and private 
<br>    offices and institutions, factories, etc 
<br>

<br>     (b) the detailed procedure for detection and treatment of infected persons
<br>

<br>(c) the detailed procedure for persons who may have been infected
<br>

<br>(d) the operation of e-judiciary,
<br>

<br>(e) provisions for delayed rental payments for commercial and residential tenants,
<br>

<br>(f) provisions for reducing the resourcing and administrative burden on public bodies,
<br>

<br>(g) provisions for limiting the impact of potential staffing shortages on the delivery 
<br>  of public services,
<br>

<br>(h) emergency registration of healthcare workers to address staff shortages
<br>

<br>(i) provisions for volunteers to address staff shortages
<br>

<br>(j) corporate social responsibility
<br>

<br>(k) aid packages for the underprivileged
<br>

<br>(l) stimulus packages for businesses
<br>

<br>(m) loan repayment schemes
<br> </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;" >It is imperative that all three organs of the State are active and functioning during this time. Powers 
<br>    that are needed to be exercised by the executive branch of the State during this pandemic are either not 
<br>    provided or have inadequate scope in existing legislation or are spread out over multiple legislation. 
<br>    The primary objective of this new legislation will be to provide a comprehensive list of temporary additional 
<br>    powers and temporary amendments to existing legislation to address this specific pandemic and the economic fallout 
<br>    arising from it. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;" >Such a law, if enacted, will avoid confusion as to the legal basis and scope of the powers of the Government that are 
    <br>    being or may be required to be exercised to tackle the pandemic. This will serve to avoid not only severe delays in 
    <br>    execution of urgent measures, but also possible future legal challenges. It is hoped that the legislature of Bangladesh 
    <br>    will step-up its game by introducing expedited legislative change to prepare for the potentially long-term impact of this 
    <br>    pandemic. We must remember that this is not the first pandemic that the world has faced and surely, this will not be the 
    <br>    last. An Act of Parliament dedicated to this particular ongoing pandemic will not only help us in effectively dealing with 
    <br>    this pandemic but also prepare us for the next one. </p>
